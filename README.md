# OPTIMIZATION OF INVESTMENT RETURN OF MULTI CURRENCY ACCOUNTS IN SRI LANKA USING AGENTIC AI



##  Overview
This research focuses on maximizing **fixed deposit returns** across **multi-currency accounts** (USD, AUD, EUR, NZD) in Sri Lanka.  
The model integrates **exchange rate forecasting** and **linear programming-based portfolio optimization** to determine the best allocation strategy and timing for investments.

---

##  Objectives
- Forecast exchange rate trends using machine learning models (ARIMA, LSTM, Hybrid models).  
- Analyze currency pair volatility using standard deviation metrics.  
- Apply linear programming to optimize deposit allocation across currencies.  
- Integrate **Agentic AI** for adaptive decision-making and strategy refinement.

---

##  Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Historical exchange rate data (USD/EUR, USD/AUD, USD/NZD).  
2. **Forecasting Models:** Bayesian Optimized LSTM model 
3. **Volatility Analysis:** Calculate standard deviation for currency pairs.  
4. **Optimization:** Use linear programming to allocate deposits (e.g., $10,000 USD) for maximum return.  
5. **Agentic AI Integration:** Automate portfolio rebalancing and adaptive optimization.

##  Results
- LSTM-based forecasting achieved the **highest accuracy** (lowest RMSE & MAPE).
